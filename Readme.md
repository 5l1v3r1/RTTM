RTS (Realtime scrapper) is a tool developed to scrap all pasties,github,reddit..etc in real time to identify occurrence of search terms configured. Upon match an email will be triggered. Thus allowing company to react in case of leakage of code, any hacks tweeted..etc.. and harden themselves against an attack before it goes viral.

The same tool in malicious user hands can be used offensively to get update on any latest hacks, code leakage etc..

Some more tweaking and testing is needed before this code is ready for prod.
